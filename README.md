# ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection + AutoML

<b> Part 1: Data Cleaning, Predictive Analysis and Feature</b>: In this part I conducted thorough predictive modeling of a Kaggle dataset using three methods (Random Forest, Logistic
Regression and KNN Classifier), handling outliers and feature selection.

- Predictive Modeling: This involves creating a model that predicts outcomes based on input features. In this case, I applied predictive modeling to a dataset obtained from Kaggle related to predicting flight delays.
- Methods Used: I employed three different machine learning algorithms - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier. Each of these algorithms has its strengths and is suitable for different types of problems.
- Data Preprocessing: Handled outliers - data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data - to ensure they don't unduly influence the model. Also, performed feature selection, choosing the most relevant features to improve model performance.
